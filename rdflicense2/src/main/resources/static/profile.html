			<p>This document presents the ODRL Profile for accessing Language Resources and Technologies (LRTs). This aims to support entities (repositories, infrastructures, archives, libraries, etc.) that enable the sharing of LRTs and act as intermediaries between LRT providers and consumers; from here on, we refer to them as "distributing entities". To this aim, it extends the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/">ODRL</a> model to define policies that express actions, rules, permissions and / or prohibitions related to sharing and processing of LRTs, and re-uses the <a href="http://w3id.org/meta-share/meta-share">META-SHARE</a> ontology to describe these policies and other access or rights related features.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2> 
		<h3>Objectives of the profile</h3>
		<p>The current profile introduces elements that serve one of these purposes:</p>
		<ul>
<li>define actions performed by the above entities in order to provide consumers with access to LRTs</li>
<li>define restrictions and actions required to implement control of the access to LRTs</li>
<li>describe vocabulary elements needed to support such policies and/or common policy patterns</li>
<li>describe vocabulary elements needed to support restrictions and authorization algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve these goals, the following requirements motivate our approach to extend the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specification to define permissions and/or prohibitions associated with access granting operations of LRTs stored and distributed by the above entities, and to re-use and extend the META-SHARE vocabulary to express legal and technical concepts associated to these operations.</p>
<p>R1. Support specifying user preferences as policies.</p>
<p>R2. Incorporate vocabulary specifying or aligned to legal concepts.</p>
<p>R3. Support specifying permissions and prohibitions typical of policies for LRTs.</p>
<p>R4. Describe policies used to authorise access to data resources and data processing services.</p>
<p>R5. Specify procedures and algorithms that can generate templates for policies typical of access to LRTs.</p>

		<h3>Overview of the LRT distribution landscape</h3> 	
<p>Sharing of Language Resources and Technologies (LRTs) is included in the mission of infrastructures and distribution bodies, such as the <a href="https://www.european-language-grid.eu/">European Language Grid</a>, <a href="https://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a> and its national nodes (e.g. the <a href="https://www.clarin.gr/en">Greek CLARIN</a>), <a href="http://www.meta-share.eu/">META-SHARE</a>, <a href="http://www.elra.info/en/">ELRA-ELDA</a>. To this end, they create and maintain repositories, that enable the upload and storage of resources, their description in a structured form (metadata records), the search and browse of these resources through dedicated catalogue pages, as well as access to them, which can be performed, for instance, by the download of content files or execution of web services.
These hosting/distributing entities (in short "distributing entities") act as intermediaries between providers and consumers of LRTs, both human and machines. Therefore, the requirements addressed in the current profile are set by the operational needs of the distributing entities, and indirectly by the needs of providers and consumers.<a>
<p>To make clearer the requirements, we briefly outline here the landscape of LRTs with a focus on issues related to legal rights and access procedures.</a>
<p>Under the term "Language Resource and Technology" we include any <b>resource</b> composed of linguistic material used in the construction, improvement and/or evaluation of language processing applications, but also, in a broader sense, in language and language-mediated research studies and applications. The term is used with a broader meaning, encompassing (a) data sets (textual, multimodal/multimedia and lexical data, grammars, language models, etc.) in machine readable form, and (b) tools/technologies/services used for their processing and management.</p>
<p>LRTs are distributed and consumed with various forms: e.g., corpora may be distributed as content files to be downloaded, or made available through dedicated interfaces (e.g., a corpus workbench, or a SPARQL endpoint); tools/services may be distributed as content files containing the source code, as executable files to be downloaded and run locally, or as web services.</p>
<p><b>Distributable forms</b> of an LRT may be accessed with the same access conditions or with different ones, which must be described in the form of a <b>policy statement</b>; this can range from a "standard" licence (e.g., one from the Creative Commons suite of licences) to a commercial licence with terms for the use of an individual resource.</p>
<p>Entities that provide access to LRTs typically support one or more of the following <b>operations</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>download of content files hosted in the repository</li>
<li>execution of services deployed in the repository</li>
<li>processing of data resources hosted in the repository with services deployed in the repository to create a new output resource (e.g., a corpus annotated with semantic information, a Machine Learning model trained on a corpus)</li>
<li>combination of data resources hosted in the repository to create a new resource which includes all or parts of the original resource ("collection")</li>
<li>combination of tools/services deployed in the repository to create a new composite tool or service ("workflow").</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy statements (licences and terms of use) that accompany a resource regulate its use by end-users but do not explicitly describe the <b>rules</b> (duties, restrictions, permissions) to be imposed by the entities when providing access to them. This set of rules may be inferred from the licensing conditions and needs to be calculated (semi-)automatically. One of the main objectives of this profile is to support the expression of these conditions, their automatic computation when possible and their representation in the form of authorisation statements and actions.</p>
		<section id="overview">
		<h3>Detailed requirements</h3> 	
<p>Entities responsible for sharing LRTs must satisfy the user requirements of both LRT providers and consumers, as described in Appendix A. To achieve this goal, the following requirements are set:</p>
<p>R1.	For granting access to an LRT,  the LRT must be released with a clear and accessible usage licence, which must be uniquely referred to in the formal description (metadata record) of the LRT (see also FAIR principle R1.1)</p>
<p>a.	The licence must be described at the level of the distributable form of the LRT; different distributable forms may be released with different licences.</p>
<p>R2.	The licence text must be available in a digital form and accessible to the end users so that they are aware of the terms under which they can use the LRT.</p>
<p>R3.	The formal description of the licence should include metadata elements (names, broad usage conditions) that support findability of the LRT.</p>
<p>R4.	The formal description of the licence should be machine actionable, i.e. include terms and indications that facilitate computational agents to perform actions that enable access to LRTs according to its licensing conditions. More precisely, it must include at least those terms that the entities granting access can use to restrict access to LRTs; such restrictions are typically based on user type, billing model, soliciting consent by users, tracking of users, monitoring of usage, etc.</p>
<p>a.	For data resources, access may be limited to download and/or processing based on user type (e.g., for academic users only, for members of a group), following payment, or deposition of a research plan, etc.</p>
<p>b.	For services, in addition, access may be limited and/or billed based on a count of specific units (e.g., count of API requests, characters to be processed, audio/video seconds to be processed) for a limited time period (e.g., on a weekly basis)</p>
<p>c.	Entities granting end users access to an LRT must ensure they grant such access in accordance with its licensing conditions to the extent that these can be controlled by them; licensing conditions that cannot be controlled by them remain at the end-user's responsibility/liability.</p>
<p>R5.	To allow combination of LRTs or processing of LRTs, their licensing conditions must be compatible and allow combination or processing actions; these permissions should be included in the formal description of the licences.</p>
<p>R6.	The formal description of the LRT should include elements that may help resolve issues related to rights and access.</p>

<h2>Profile specification</h2>
<h3>Entities</h3>
The current specification focuses on three classes taken from the <a href="http://w3id.org/meta-share/meta-share">META-SHARE</a> vocabulary: <code>Resource</code>, <code>Distribution</code> and <code>LicenceTerms</code>. For the first two classes, we reuse the META-SHARE vocabulary and include here only those properties that are of interest to this specification. In addition, the <code>LicenceTerm</code> is further represented as a <code>policy</code> in accordance with the ODRL model. 
<section id="resources">
<h4>Resources</h4>
A distinction is made between the <em>language resource / technology</em>, as the object created and described at an abstract level, and its <em>distributable form</em>, i.e., the form as packaged, distributed and consumed by end users. Following the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/">DCAT</a> terminology, the former is represented with the class <code>LanguageResource</code> and the latter as <code>DatasetDistribution</code> and <code>SoftwareDistribution</code>.

		<h3>1 How to Represent a General Permission</h3>
		The following ODRL policy might be read as "<i>Movie 9898 can be used</i>".
		<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 1.0</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
00  {
01	 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
02	 "@type": "Set",
03	 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
04	 "permission": [{
05 		"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
06 		"action": "use"
07	 }]
08  }		
		</pre></div>
		Explanation line by line:
		<ul>
		<li>An ODRL policy is represented as a JSON Object (lines 00 and 08). In particular, ODRL policies can be represented in <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> -a lightweight Linked Data format.</li>
	    <li>The context of the JSON-LD policy is, as in every ODRL policy, <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld</code> (see line 01).</li>
	    <li>Type <code>odrl:Set</code> means this is positive assertion. Somebody <i>affirms</i> that Movie 9898 can be used (line 02).</li>
	    <li>The policy is identified as <code>http://example.com/policy:1010</code>. ODRL policies are best identified with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">URI</a>s (see line 03).</li>
		<li>ODRL policies have one or more rules: permissions, obligations, prohibitions (line 04). You may want to see the main <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#infoModel">ODRL diagram</a>.  </li>
	    <li>The target of the policy is the resource referenced by <code>http://example.com/asset:9898.movie</code>, probably a movie (line 05). Assets are best identified with URIs.</li>
	    <li>The permitted action on the asset is <i>use</i> (line 06). You may want to read its <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-use">definition</a>, or browse other possible actions predefined by the ODRL specs.</li>
		</ul>
		
<h4>1.1 How to restrict the permission to a specified party</h4>		
If the example above permitted the general use of Movie 9898, this permission permits only John to play the movie.
<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 1.1</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "permission": [{
 	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"assignee": "John",
	"action": "play"
 }]
}		
		</pre></div>

<h4>1.2 How to restrict the validity of a permission to a specific circumstance or set of circumstances</h4>		
<p>Photographs are often licensed on a geographic basis: global rights will likely be more expensive than a country-specific permission. Such conditions are frequently modelled in ODRL by Constraints.</p>

<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 1.2A</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "permission": [{
 	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"action": "display",
	"constraint": [{
           "leftOperand": "spatial",
           "operator": "eq",
           "rightOperand":  "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183",
	   "comment": "i.e Germany"
       }]
 }]
}		
		</pre></div>

<p>Photographs for the news media can sometimes be "embargoed" - only publishable after a certain data. We can achieve this by putting a time-Constraint on the Permission.</p>
			
<p>The following permission can only be exercised after the turn of the New Year in 2019.</p>

<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 1.2B</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "permission": [{
 	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"action": "display",
	"constraint": [{
           "leftOperand": "dateTime",
           "operator": "gt",
           "rightOperand":  { "@value": "2019-01-01", "@type": "xsd:date" }
       }]
 }]
}		
		</pre></div>	
			
<p>We can easily create a permission that only allows the picture to be displayed in Germany after 2018 by adding both Constraints. In this simple scenario ODRL insists both Constraints are satisfied before the Permission becomes active.</p> 

<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 1.2C</span></div>
<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "permission": [{
 	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"action": "display",
	"constraint": [{
           "leftOperand": "dateTime",
           "operator": "gt",
           "rightOperand":  { "@value": "2019-01-01", "@type": "xsd:date" }
	   }, {
           "leftOperand": "spatial",
           "operator": "eq",
           "rightOperand":  "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q183",
	   "comment": "i.e Germany"
       }]
 }]
}		
</pre></div>	

<h3>2 How to refine the specification of an Action, Asset, or Party</h3>
<p>Constraints can also be used to 'inject' additional semantics into the definition of an Action, Asset, or Party</p>
			
<h4>2.1 Narrowing the applicability of an Action</h4>			
<p>The following Permission allows the distribution of a video but resticts the delivery channel to mobile networks only. This video cannot be distributed from a website under this Permission.</p>
			
<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 2.1</span></div>
<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Set",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:6161",
    "permission": [{
       "target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
       "assigner": "http://example.com/org:616",
       "action": [{
          "action": "distribute",
          "refinement": [{
             "leftOperand": "deliveryChannel",
             "operator": "eq",
             "rightOperand": "http://example.com/cv/audMedia/MOBILE"
          }]
      }]
   }]
}
</pre></div>

<h4>2.2 Further specifying an Asset</h4>
<p>In financial markets the value of a piece of data is sometimes proportional to its timeliness. 15-minute delayed stock price is often much cheaper than real-time. We'd probably want different permissions to reflect this. How would we specify the 15 minute delay?</p>
<p>We could model them as two different Assets. Or we could use Constraints on the same Asset, the stock price:</p>
			
			
			
			
<h3>2 How to represent an obligation</h3>
Example 3 shows how to oblige John to play the movie.

<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 3</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "obligation": [{
	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"assignee": "John",
	"action": "play"
 }]
}		
		</pre></div>

<h3>3 How to represent a prohibition </h3>
Example 4 shows how to prohibit John playing the movie.

<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 4</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "prohibition": [{
	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"assignee": "John",
	"action": "play"
 }]
}		
		</pre></div>

	
<h3>4 How to represent a permission and a prohibition</h3>		
	An ODRL can represent one or more <em>rules</em>. For example, the following ODRL policiy might be read as "Alice can use Asset 1, but Bob can't".

	<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 5</span></div>
	<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
	"@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
	"@type": "Set",
	"uid": "http://example.org/policy/5",
	"permission": [{
		"target": "http://example.com/asset/1",
		"assignee": "http://example.com/party/Alice",
		"action": "use"
	}],
	"prohibition": [{
		"target": "http://example.com/asset/1",
		"assignee": "http://example.com/party/Bob",
		"action": "use"
	}]
}		
</pre></div>

<h3>5 How to simplify policies with more than one rule</h3>	
ODRL policies with more than one rule can be simplified (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#composition-compact
">Section 2.7.1</a> in the Information Model). Elements common to every rule can be expressed at root lovel. Policies making use of this feature are called <b>compact policies</b>, an example of them follows.

	<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 6</span></div>
	<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
	"@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
	"@type": "Set",
	"uid": "http://example.org/policy/5",
	"action": "use",
	"target": "http://example.com/asset/1",
	"permission": [{
		"assignee": "http://example.com/party/Alice",
	}],
	"prohibition": [{
		"assignee": "http://example.com/party/Bob",
	}]
}	
	</pre></div>
	
<h4>6 How to represent an agreement and an offer</h4>		
All the examples above declared that there existed a certain permission, prohibition or obligation. Example 7 shows ....

<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 7</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
 "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
 "@type": "Set",
 "uid": "http://example.com/policy:1010",
 "prohibition": [{
	"target": "http://example.com/asset:9898.movie",
	"assignee": "John",
	"action": "play"
 }]
}		
		</pre></div>
	
<h4>7 How to generalize actions</h4>		
	Permitting (or prohibiting) some general actions entail permitting (or prohibitting) other specific actions. In the example below, permitting <code>display</code> is redundant because having permitted <code>play</code> also implies permitting <code>display</code>.  
	
	<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 8</span></div>
	<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
{
	"@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
	"@type": "Set",
	"uid": "http://example.org/policy/5",
	"permission": [{
		"assignee": "http://example.com/party/Alice",
		"action": [ "play", <strike>"display"</strike> ],
		"target": "http://example.com/asset/1"
	}]
}	
	</pre></div>	
	The figure represents these dependencies. 
		
	<center><img src="includedin.png" width=600px /></center>
	<span class="fig-title">Actions in the ODRL Core Vocabulary (and how they are dependant)</span>
	
	Also, one action in the profile may declare that some other actions are necessary for their execution (using <code>:implies</code>), hence if the former is permitted the latter cannot be prohibited. 
	
	Although the actions in the ODRL Core Vocabulary do not have these implications, and although the actions in the ODRL Core Vocabulary are hardly dependent from each other, this may be of interest if you some day want to define your own actions.
	
	
	
		<h3>92. Representing ODRL with RDF Turtle (I)</h3>		
		JSON-LD is only one of the possible serializations of ODRL a policy. The following example shows the same policy as in Example 1 but in RDF Turtle. It can also be XML.
		An <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-odrl/#term-Policy">ODRL policy</a> is an instance of the class <code>odrl:Policy</code>, which is defined in the ODRL Ontology. No knowledge on the ODRL Ontology is needed if you want to use ODRL.
		
		Example 1 and Example 2 have the same meaning.
		<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 2</span></div>
		<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
@prefix odrl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/&gt;

&lt;http://example.org/policy/1&gt; a odrl:Policy, odrl:Set ;
  odrl:permission [
    odrl:target &lt;http://example.com/asset/1&gt; ;
    odrl:assignee &lt;http://example.com/party/Alice&gt; ;
    odrl:action odrl:use
  ] ;
		</pre></div>	
	
<h3>93. Representing ODRL with RDF Turtle (II)</h3>		
	As per RDFS <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#RDFSRules">entailment rule rdfs2</a>, the class of the policy resource <code>odrl:Policy</code> can be inferred, hence its specification is not necessary. As per the ODRL Information Model (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy-set">2.1.1 Set Class</a>), Set is the default type of policy, hence its specification is not necessary. The policy shown in Example 3 is also equivalent to the policies in Example 1 and Example 2 (odrl prefix declaration has also been removed for clarity).

	<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 3a</span></div>
	<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
&lt;http://example.com/policy:1010&gt; odrl:permission [
  odrl:target &lt;http://example.com/asset:9898.movie&gt; ;
  odrl:action odrl:use
] ;
	</pre></div>
	Alternative forms for the same policy are also possible. For example, one might want to attribute a certain policy to a certain asset. 
	As specified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy-has">ODRL Information Model</a>, the following code would be equivalent.
	The RDF triple in line 02 of Example 3b may be stored in a content repository, whereas lines 03 through 06 may be stored in a license repository.
	<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 3b</span></div>
	<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
01 @prefix dct: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; 
02 &lt;http://example.com/asset:9898.movie&gt; odrl:hasPolicy &lt;http://example.com/policy:1010&gt; .
03 &lt;http://example.com/policy:1010&gt; odrl:permission [
04   odrl:target &lt;http://example.com/asset:9898.movie&gt; ;
05   odrl:action odrl:use
06 ] ;
	</pre></div>	
	
	
<h3>94. Representing ODRL with RDF Turtle (III)</h3>		

Example XXX shows a second example, equivalent to Example 2.
	<div class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example XXX</span></div>
	<pre id="eg2" class="hljs json" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">
