			<p>This document presents the ODRL Profile for accessing Language Resources and Technologies (LRTs). This aims to support entities (repositories, infrastructures, archives, libraries, etc.) that enable the sharing of LRTs and act as intermediaries between LRT providers and consumers; from here on, we refer to them as "distributing entities". To this aim, it extends the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/">ODRL</a> model to define policies that express actions, rules, permissions and / or prohibitions related to sharing and processing of LRTs, and re-uses the <a href="http://w3id.org/meta-share/meta-share">META-SHARE</a> ontology to describe these policies and other access or rights related features.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2> 
		<h3>Objectives of the profile</h3>
		<p>The current profile introduces elements that serve one of these purposes:</p>
		<ul>
<li>define actions performed by the above entities in order to provide consumers with access to LRTs</li>
<li>define restrictions and actions required to implement control of the access to LRTs</li>
<li>describe vocabulary elements needed to support such policies and/or common policy patterns</li>
<li>describe vocabulary elements needed to support restrictions and authorization algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve these goals, the following requirements motivate our approach to extend the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specification to define permissions and/or prohibitions associated with access granting operations of LRTs stored and distributed by the above entities, and to re-use and extend the META-SHARE vocabulary to express legal and technical concepts associated to these operations.</p>
<p>R1. Support specifying user preferences as policies.</p>
<p>R2. Incorporate vocabulary specifying or aligned to legal concepts.</p>
<p>R3. Support specifying permissions and prohibitions typical of policies for LRTs.</p>
<p>R4. Describe policies used to authorise access to data resources and data processing services.</p>
<p>R5. Specify procedures and algorithms that can generate templates for policies typical of access to LRTs.</p>

		<h3>Overview of the LRT distribution landscape</h3> 	
<p>Sharing of Language Resources and Technologies (LRTs) is included in the mission of infrastructures and distribution bodies, such as the <a href="https://www.european-language-grid.eu/">European Language Grid</a>, <a href="https://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a> and its national nodes (e.g. the <a href="https://www.clarin.gr/en">Greek CLARIN</a>), <a href="http://www.meta-share.eu/">META-SHARE</a>, <a href="http://www.elra.info/en/">ELRA-ELDA</a>. To this end, they create and maintain repositories, that enable the upload and storage of resources, their description in a structured form (metadata records), the search and browse of these resources through dedicated catalogue pages, as well as access to them, which can be performed, for instance, by the download of content files or execution of web services.
These hosting/distributing entities (in short "distributing entities") act as intermediaries between providers and consumers of LRTs, both human and machines. Therefore, the requirements addressed in the current profile are set by the operational needs of the distributing entities, and indirectly by the needs of providers and consumers.<a>
<p>To make clearer the requirements, we briefly outline here the landscape of LRTs with a focus on issues related to legal rights and access procedures.</a>
<p>Under the term "Language Resource and Technology" we include any <b>resource</b> composed of linguistic material used in the construction, improvement and/or evaluation of language processing applications, but also, in a broader sense, in language and language-mediated research studies and applications. The term is used with a broader meaning, encompassing (a) data sets (textual, multimodal/multimedia and lexical data, grammars, language models, etc.) in machine readable form, and (b) tools/technologies/services used for their processing and management.</p>
<p>LRTs are distributed and consumed with various forms: e.g., corpora may be distributed as content files to be downloaded, or made available through dedicated interfaces (e.g., a corpus workbench, or a SPARQL endpoint); tools/services may be distributed as content files containing the source code, as executable files to be downloaded and run locally, or as web services.</p>
<p><b>Distributable forms</b> of an LRT may be accessed with the same access conditions or with different ones, which must be described in the form of a <b>policy statement</b>; this can range from a "standard" licence (e.g., one from the Creative Commons suite of licences) to a commercial licence with terms for the use of an individual resource.</p>
<p>Entities that provide access to LRTs typically support one or more of the following <b>operations</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>download of content files hosted in the repository</li>
<li>execution of services deployed in the repository</li>
<li>processing of data resources hosted in the repository with services deployed in the repository to create a new output resource (e.g., a corpus annotated with semantic information, a Machine Learning model trained on a corpus)</li>
<li>combination of data resources hosted in the repository to create a new resource which includes all or parts of the original resource ("collection")</li>
<li>combination of tools/services deployed in the repository to create a new composite tool or service ("workflow").</li>
</ul>
<p>The policy statements (licences and terms of use) that accompany a resource regulate its use by end-users but do not explicitly describe the <b>rules</b> (duties, restrictions, permissions) to be imposed by the entities when providing access to them. This set of rules may be inferred from the licensing conditions and needs to be calculated (semi-)automatically. One of the main objectives of this profile is to support the expression of these conditions, their automatic computation when possible and their representation in the form of authorisation statements and actions.</p>
		<section id="overview">
		<h3>Detailed requirements</h3> 	
<p>Entities responsible for sharing LRTs must satisfy the user requirements of both LRT providers and consumers, as described in Appendix A. To achieve this goal, the following requirements are set:</p>
<p>R1.	For granting access to an LRT,  the LRT must be released with a clear and accessible usage licence, which must be uniquely referred to in the formal description (metadata record) of the LRT (see also FAIR principle R1.1)</p>
<p>a.	The licence must be described at the level of the distributable form of the LRT; different distributable forms may be released with different licences.</p>
<p>R2.	The licence text must be available in a digital form and accessible to the end users so that they are aware of the terms under which they can use the LRT.</p>
<p>R3.	The formal description of the licence should include metadata elements (names, broad usage conditions) that support findability of the LRT.</p>
<p>R4.	The formal description of the licence should be machine actionable, i.e. include terms and indications that facilitate computational agents to perform actions that enable access to LRTs according to its licensing conditions. More precisely, it must include at least those terms that the entities granting access can use to restrict access to LRTs; such restrictions are typically based on user type, billing model, soliciting consent by users, tracking of users, monitoring of usage, etc.</p>
<p>a.	For data resources, access may be limited to download and/or processing based on user type (e.g., for academic users only, for members of a group), following payment, or deposition of a research plan, etc.</p>
<p>b.	For services, in addition, access may be limited and/or billed based on a count of specific units (e.g., count of API requests, characters to be processed, audio/video seconds to be processed) for a limited time period (e.g., on a weekly basis)</p>
<p>c.	Entities granting end users access to an LRT must ensure they grant such access in accordance with its licensing conditions to the extent that these can be controlled by them; licensing conditions that cannot be controlled by them remain at the end-user's responsibility/liability.</p>
<p>R5.	To allow combination of LRTs or processing of LRTs, their licensing conditions must be compatible and allow combination or processing actions; these permissions should be included in the formal description of the licences.</p>
<p>R6.	The formal description of the LRT should include elements that may help resolve issues related to rights and access.</p>

<h2>Profile specification</h2>
<h3>Entities</h3>
The current specification focuses on three classes taken from the <a href="http://w3id.org/meta-share/meta-share">META-SHARE</a> vocabulary: <code>Resource</code>, <code>Distribution</code> and <code>LicenceTerms</code>. For the first two classes, we reuse the META-SHARE vocabulary and include here only those properties that are of interest to this specification. In addition, the <code>LicenceTerm</code> is further represented as a <code>policy</code> in accordance with the ODRL model. 
<section id="resources">
<h4>Resources</h4>
A distinction is made between the <em>language resource / technology</em>, as the object created and described at an abstract level, and its <em>distributable form</em>, i.e., the form as packaged, distributed and consumed by end users. Following the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/">DCAT</a> terminology, the former is represented with the class <code>LanguageResource</code> and the latter as <code>DatasetDistribution</code> and <code>SoftwareDistribution</code>.

<h4>Distribution properties</h4>
<p>Properties of the <code>Distribution</code> subclasses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>linking to policy documents regulating the access conditions, addressing R1 and R1a: <code>licenceTerms</code> and <code>accessRights</code>
<li>describing restrictions related to the billing module, time restrictions or membership to a group and addressing R4: <code>cost</code>, <code>membershipInstitution</code>, <code>availabilityStartDate</code>, <code>availabilityEndDate</code>. These are used in combination with the <code>licenceTerms</code> to refine licences with extra restrictions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The property <code>licenceTerms</code> addresses R1 and R1a. It is the property used for linking LRTs to the policy statements (class <code>LicenceTerms</code>). This is a mandatory property since without a licence, LRTs must not be accessible to end-users. Multiple licences are allowed for the same <code>Distribution</code> in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>a data resource (e.g. a lexicon or corpus) accessible with an interface, in which case the data and the interface are licensed with different licences</li>
<li>a collection created by subsets released with different licences.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the access procedure must take into account all licences attached to this Distribution.</p>
<p>LRTs whose licence is not identified in the formal description may be included in a catalogue for information purposes only, clearly marked as such and described with at least an access statement which is added with the <code>accessRights</code> property.</p>

<section id="policies">
<h2>Policies (Licences and Terms of use/service)</h2>
<h3>LicenceTerms</h3>
<p>This class covers legal documents, i.e., licences and terms of use or service for data resources and software.</p>
<!-- TODO add tables -->

</section>
<section id="policiesProp">
<h3>Licence properties</h3>
<p>The following set of properties addresses identification of the licence and access to the licence text (R2 and R3) are:</p> <code>name</code>, <code>short name</code>, <code>alternative title</code>, <code>URL</code> (where the licence text can be found), <code>logo</code>, <code>identifier</code>.</p>
<p>The property <code>conditionOfUse</code> aims to encode the main conditions associated with the use of a LRT (e.g. non commercial use, use by academic users only, etc.) as described in R4a and R4b. These can also be represented as odrl properties (permission, prohibition, duty), but are also added as an object property for two reasons: (a) facilitating LRT providers with no or little prior experience of writing policies in ODRL; (b) supporting the implementation of a filter enhancing the discoverability of LRTs in a catalogue (R3). The class <code>ConditionOfUse</code> contains a set of instances that are typical of licences in the LRT domain.</p>
<p>The object property <code>licenceCategory</code> addresses R4; i.e., it supports the encoding of terms that can be mapped to actions granting access to LRTs and the authorization procedures required for them. As with <code>conditionOfUse</code>, these can be mapped to ODRL rules and added to the RDF representations of a licence.</p> 
<p>A set of such mappings has already been made for the typical cases in the LRT domain and is available at ??.<p>

<section id="parties">
<h2>Parties</h2>
<h3>Party roles and types</h3>
<p>With respect to the transactions of LRT distribution, the following roles can be identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource providers</li>
<li>Resource consumers (end users)</li>
<li>Hosting/Distributing entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the scope of the current profile, these roles do not need to be formally represented, as the ODRL roles <code>odrl:assigner</code> and <code>odrl:assignee</code> suffice. </p>
<p>In terms of legal status, distributing entities can only be organizations, resource providers can be both organizations and individuals, while resource consumers can be only individuals, affiliated or not to organizations. These can be described with any relevant vocabulary such as W3C vCard Ontology, FOAF Vocabulary enriched with META-SHARE and ODRL properties, as required.</p>
<!-- TODO add tables -->
</section>
<section id="partyProps">
<h3>Party properties</h3>
<p>The only property specific to this profile is the <code>userType</code>, which distinguishes LRT consumers into commercial and academic ones. This is required because this distinction is related to restrictions on using an LRT or on the price or billing model of an LRT.</p>
<!-- TODO add tables -->
</section>
<section id="Actions">
<h3>Actions</h3>
<h4>Operations</h4>
<p>To cover the operations performed in the context of this profile, the following concepts are used from the ODRL and MS-OWL vocabularies: <code>odrl:execute, <code>odrl:aggregate, <code>ms:download, <code>ms:process and <code>ms:combine.</p>
<!-- TODO add tables -->
</section>
<section id="Actions for constraints">
<h3>Actions for Constraints</h3>
<p>The following subclasses of <code>odrl:Action</code> are required in use with constraints on rules to describe common practices in the domain of LRT distribution: <code>signIn</code>, <code>authorize</code>.</p>
