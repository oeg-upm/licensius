About this Licence

The Controller of Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) has developed this licence as a tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common non-commercial licence. The Controller invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence where licensing under the default Open Government Licence is not appropriate.

The Controller of HMSO has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown.

This is version 1.0 of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. The Controller of HMSO may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. However, you may continue to use Information licensed under this version should you wish to do so.

Further context, best practice and guidance can be found in the UK Government Licensing Framework section on The National Archives website.
