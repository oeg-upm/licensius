META-SHARE Commons BY_NC_ND v1.0 1 
META-SHARE IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. 
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENCE DOES NOT CREATE AN AGENT-CLIENT 
RELATIONSHIP. META-SHARE PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" 
BASIS. META-SHARE MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE 
INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES 
RESULTING FROM ITS USE. 
META-SHARE Commons BY NC ND Licence 
This META-SHARE Licence enables You to Use the Resource worldwide for noncommercial 
purposes provided that You keep to the terms of this Licence. 
1. Definitions of Capitalised Words 
a. "Collective Work" means a work made up of the Work in its entirety in 
unmodified form, along with other work, assembled into a collective whole. 
b. "Derivative" means any material that Uses the Resource (or any substantial 
part of it) in any material form whatsoever (such as a translation, dramatisation 
or abridgment), other than (i) as a whole and in unmodified form or (ii) by 
modifying it as may be technically necessary to Use it in a different mode or 
format; but a Collective Work is not a Derivative for the purpose of this Licence. 
c. "Derogatory Treatment" means a treatment which distorts or mutilates the 
Resource or is otherwise prejudicial to the honour or reputation of the Original 
Author or the Licensor. 
d. "Licence Elements" means the following licence attributes indicated in the

conditions of this Licence. 
f. "META-SHARE " is a network of distributed repositories of LRs.

in the Attribution Data. 
h. "Person" means a natural person or a body of persons corporate or

META-SHARE Commons BY_NC_ND v1.0 2 
i. "Use", as a verb, means doing any act which is restricted by copyright or 
neighbouring rights (including database rights), whether in the original medium 
or any other; and includes modifying the Resource as may be technically 
necessary to Use it in a different mode or format. 
j. "Work" means any work protected by copyright (or by database rights if 
applicable) which is offered under the terms of this Licence, and includes works 
forming only a part of the Resource as well works as incorporated in any 
Collective Work. 
k. "You" means the Person acquiring rights under this Licence. 
l. "Attribution Data" means a field of metadata accompanying every Resource, 
containing a specified string of characters to be used for attribution of the 
Resource. 
m. "Resource" means the language resource offered to You under the terms of 
this Licence. 
n. Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. 
2. The Rights Granted 
2.1 Subject to the exceptions under clause 2.2, and the conditions and reservations 
under clauses 2.3 to 2.9 below, the Licensor grants to You a worldwide, clear of any 
third party rights, non-exclusive, Non Commercial licence to Use the Resource within 
the META-SHARE network. This licence covers the copyright and the sui generis 
database right over the Resource and is an agreement between You and the Licensor for 
access to the Resources. For the purpose of this Licence, Use within the META-SHARE 
network is encompassing all acts under clause 1. i. 
So you may, for example 
a. copy the Resource, or incorporate it into a Collective Work; 
b. extract and re-utilise of the whole or substantial parts of the Resource; 
c. copy the Resource as incorporated in any Collective Work; and 
d. publish, perform or communicate the Resource and/or the Resource as 
incorporated in any Collective Work to anyone 
by any means and in any medium whether now known or created in the future. 

META-SHARE Commons BY_NC_ND v1.0 3 
2.2 However, this Licence does not allow you to: 
a. Use the Resource for any purpose other than research or in any way primarily 
intended for commercial advantage or payment; but exchange for other 
protected material without payment (whether by means of digital file-sharing or 
otherwise) is not to be taken to be so intended; 
b. create any derivative works; 
c. impose any terms or any technological measures on the Resource, that alter or 
restrict the terms of this Licence or any rights granted under it or have the effect 
or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights; 
d. sublicense the Resource; or 
e. subject the Resource to Derogatory Treatment. 
2.3 You must, if you publish or distribute the Resource to anyone else in any way, 
give reasonable credit to the Original Author or owner of the sui generis database right 
as prescribed in the Attribution Data. 
These are important conditions of this Licence, and if you fail to comply with them you 
will be in material breach of its terms. 
2.4 The Original Author asserts the right to be identified as the original author of 
the Work, as forming part of the Resource if applicable; but only as and when required 
by clause 2.3 above.

META-SHARE in any way: 
a. include a copy of this Licence with it; and 
b. keep intact any copyright and sui generis database right notices for the 
Resource and notices that refer to this Licence. 
These are important conditions of this Licence, and if you fail to comply with them you 
will be in material breach of its terms. 
2.6 Each time You publish the Resource to anyone else within META-SHARE in any 
way, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the Resource on the same terms 
and conditions as this Licence. 

META-SHARE Commons BY_NC_ND v1.0 4

d. the right to release the Resource under different terms, or to stop distributing 
the Resource, is reserved; and 
e. all other rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are reserved. 
2.8 This Licence does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may 
independently have under any applicable law (including fair dealing, fair use, or any 
other legally recognised limitation or exception to copyright infringement) to make any 
Use of this Resource. 
2.9 This Licence does not allow You to claim any endorsement or approval by the 
Licensor or the Original Author of You or your use of the Resource without their 
express written permission. 
3. Warranties and Disclaimer 
The Resource is licensed by the Licensor "as is" and without any warranty of any kind, 
either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy, of fitness for purpose, or 
otherwise. 
4. Limit of Liability 
Subject to any liability which may not be excluded or limited by law, the Licensor shall 
not be liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and 
whenever caused to anyone by any Use under this Licence, whether by You or by 
anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. If 
liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to 
the extent it is caused by proved gross negligence on the part of the Licensor. 
5. Termination 

META-SHARE Commons BY_NC_ND v1.0 5 
5.1 Any breach by You of the terms of this licence (for example, by distributing the 
Resource without attributing as appropriate) entitles the Licensor to terminate your 
Licence with immediate effect and without notice to you. Persons who have received 
the Resource or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will not have 
their licences terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this Licence or a 
licence granted under clause 2.6 of this Licence. 
5.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this Licence, the Licensor may not 
terminate your rights under it. 
5.3 Unless terminated under clause 5.1, this Licence is granted to you for the 
duration of any rights in the Resource as mentioned in clause 2.1. 
6. General 
6.1 If any provision of this Licence is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that shall 
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence. 
6.2 This Licence is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
Resource licensed here but hereby allows for additional agreements that grant more 
rights than this License. It replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or 
representations with respect to the Resource not specified here. 
6.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this Licence (for example, by distributing the 
Resource without attributing as appropriate) you will not be entitled to rely on the 
terms of this Licence or to complain of any breach by the Licensor. 
6.4 If there is any dispute as to the meaning or effect of any provision of this 
Licence, it must so far as possible be read and given effect in a way that is compatible 
with the provisions of any subsequent version of the META-SHARE Commons licence, 
which has the same Licence Elements. 
6.5 As far as arbitration processes have been established within META-SHARE, any 
dispute arising in connection with this Licence or the Resource has to adhere to these 
processes before being filed at public justice bodies. 

META-SHARE Commons BY_NC_ND v1.0 6
